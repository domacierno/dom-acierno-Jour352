    The DIV tag divides the HTML doc so that the CSS doc can apply the style only to the contents within the DIV tags. You assign ID's and classes within a DIV to target those elements in CSS.

3.  Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

10.  Why do we use media queries?

    We use media queries when we want our website to conform to different dimensions, screen sizes, resolutions. They help make the site easier to navigate when accessing through your phone or tablet instead of your computer.

11.  What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

    The serif font has the extra designs on the tips of the letters to give them a more classical look. Sans-serif does not have these extra features on the letters which gives the font a more modern, simple look.
